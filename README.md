# Wasps

It's 2006 in Ipswich and there's nothing to do but play cards and drink beer.

Living in the middle of nowhere, working at BT on a summer internship with no Internet access outside of work what else was there to do?

I created this originally in C#/.NET 1.1 to run on Windows XP and PocketPC.

I've now updated it to run in a browser on basically anything.
