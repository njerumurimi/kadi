To implement this rule, we need to modify the `applyTurn` function to enforce the requirement that playing a Queen or an Eight (a "question") must be followed by an "answer." The answer must match the suit of the question or be a set of cards of the same rank where the first card matches the suit.

### Steps for Implementation:

1. **Identify if a "question" is played**  
   - A card is a question if it's a Queen (`CardRank.Queen`) or an Eight (`CardRank.Eight`).
   - If multiple questions are played, they must be of the same suit.

2. **Check for a valid answer**  
   - The first answer must match the suit of the last question.
   - Additional answers can be of the same rank.
   - If an answer is not provided, the player must pick up a card.

3. **Modify `applyTurn` to enforce these rules**  
   - Determine if a turn contains a question.
   - If a question is played, ensure it is followed by a valid answer.
   - If no answer is given, force the player to pick up a card.

### Code Implementation (Modifications to `applyTurn`)

Modify `applyTurn` inside `Game.ts`:

```typescript
applyTurn = (playerIndex: number, turn: TurnCommand) => {
    const pickupCard = () => {
        if (this.pile.length === 0) {
            this.played.forEach((turn, idx) => {
                if (idx === this.played.length - 1) return;
                turn.played.forEach(card => this.pile.push(card));
                this.pile = this.random.shuffle(this.pile);
            });
        }
        return this.pile.shift()!;
    }

    let turnEvent: TurnEvent;
    const playedCards = turn.played;

    // Identify questions (Queens and Eights)
    const questions = playedCards.filter(card => card.rank === CardRank.Queen || card.rank === CardRank.Eight);
    const answers = playedCards.filter(card => !questions.includes(card));

    if (questions.length > 0) {
        // Validate questions are of the same suit or follow the order rule (Queen/Eight of the same suit)
        const questionSuits = new Set(questions.map(card => card.suit));
        if (questionSuits.size > 2) {
            this.eventHandler.onInvalidMove(playerIndex, "Questions must be of the same suit or match the previous question.");
            return;
        }

        // Get the last question's suit for answer validation
        const lastQuestionSuit = questions[questions.length - 1].suit;

        // Validate answers
        if (answers.length === 0) {
            // No answer provided, force pickup
            const drawnCard = pickupCard();
            this.hands[playerIndex].push(drawnCard);
            this.eventHandler.onCardPickedUp(playerIndex, drawnCard);
            return;
        } else {
            // The first answer must match the suit of the last question
            if (answers[0].suit !== lastQuestionSuit) {
                this.eventHandler.onInvalidMove(playerIndex, "First answer must match the suit of the last question.");
                return;
            }

            // Additional answers must be of the same rank
            const firstAnswerRank = answers[0].rank;
            if (!answers.every(card => card.rank === firstAnswerRank)) {
                this.eventHandler.onInvalidMove(playerIndex, "All answers must be of the same rank.");
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    // Proceed with normal turn processing
    turnEvent = {
        played: turn.played,
        suit: this.suitChoice,
        pickup: [],
        directionChanged: false,
    };

    this.played.push(turnEvent);
    this.eventHandler.onTurnPlayed(playerIndex, turnEvent);
};
```

### Summary of Changes:

1. **Identifies if Queens or Eights (questions) are played.**
2. **Ensures questions follow the suit-matching rule when multiple are played.**
3. **Checks if an answer is provided.**
4. **Validates that the first answer matches the last questionâ€™s suit.**
5. **Ensures additional answers are of the same rank.**
6. **Forces a pickup if an answer is missing.**

This should fully implement the rule while maintaining game integrity. Let me know if you need any refinements!
