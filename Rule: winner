You need to modify the `winningPlayer` method to ensure that a player can only win if their final played card is not a special card. Right now, a player wins if their hand is empty, but you want to add a check for the last played card.

### Modify `winningPlayer` Method:
Replace the current method with the following logic:

```ts
winningPlayer = () => {
    // Find the index of the player who has emptied their hand
    const winnerIndex = this.hands.findIndex(hand => hand.length === 0);

    if (winnerIndex >= 0) {
        // Get the last played card
        const lastTurn = this.played[this.played.length - 1];
        const lastCard = lastTurn?.played[lastTurn.played.length - 1];

        // Only allow a win if the last card is NOT a special card
        if (lastCard && !isSpecial(lastCard)) {
            return this.players[winnerIndex];
        }
    }
    return null;
};
```

### Explanation:
- The function finds the first player with an empty hand.
- It retrieves the last played card.
- If the last played card is not a special card (Ace, 2, 3, 8, Queen, King, Jack, or Joker), the player is declared the winner.
- Otherwise, the game continues (the player may need to draw a card next turn).
