Got it. You just want to remove the rule that enforces playing consecutive ranked cards together, meaning players can still play them if they choose, but it's no longer a requirement.  

This should be a simple fixâ€”just remove the logic that checks for consecutive ranks in the validation step while keeping the rest of the card-playing mechanics intact. Do you need help locating the rule in your code, or have you already found where it enforces this restriction?


To remove the rule that allows players to play consecutive ranked cards, we need to modify the validation logic in `validateCardList` inside **turnbuilder.ts**. The specific condition that currently allows runs of consecutive cards needs to be removed.

### **Steps to modify:**
1. **Locate `validateCardList` in turnbuilder.ts**  
   This function currently allows sequences of consecutive cards as long as they are in order.
   
2. **Remove the logic that checks for consecutive runs**  
   - The part where it checks `isWithinOne` and `isListInOrder` should be removed.
   - Instead, only allow playing multiple cards if they are of the **same rank**.

### **Updated `validateCardList` function**
Modify this function in `turnbuilder.ts`:

```ts
const validateCardList = (cards: Card[]) => {
    if (cards.length === 1) return [] as string[];

    let rankDiffers = false;
    let suitDiffers = false;

    let firstCard = cards[0];
    let firstRank = firstCard.rank;
    let firstSuit = firstCard.suit;

    cards.forEach(card => {
        if (card.rank !== firstRank) rankDiffers = true;
        if (card.suit !== firstSuit) suitDiffers = true;
    });

    // If both suit and rank change, it's invalid
    if (suitDiffers && rankDiffers) return ["Multiple cards must be of the same suit or rank."];

    // Allow same rank cards to be played together
    if (!rankDiffers) return [];

    // Remove the logic that allows consecutive ranked cards
    return ["You may only play multiple cards of the same rank."];
};
```

### **What changed?**
- **Removed the logic** that allowed sequences of consecutive cards (e.g., 3-4-5).
- Now, only cards of **the same rank** can be played together (e.g., 7-7-7).
- The function now simply checks if the ranks are all the same and only allows that.

With this change, players can no longer play consecutive ranked cards, ensuring they can only play multiple cards if they are **exactly the same rank**.
