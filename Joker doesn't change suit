To ensure that only an Ace can change the suit and not a Joker, you need to update the `changesSuit` function in `card.ts`. 

### Update `changesSuit` function:
#### **Before**
```ts
export const changesSuit = (card: Card) => {
    return (((card.rank === CardRank.Joker) && (card.suit === CardSuit.Joker)) || (card.rank === CardRank.Ace));
}
```
#### **After**
```ts
export const changesSuit = (card: Card) => {
    return card.rank === CardRank.Ace;
}
```
### Explanation:
- The previous function allowed both Jokers and Aces to change the suit.
- The new function ensures **only Aces** can change the suit.

This update will ensure that a Joker no longer has the ability to change suits in your game logic.
