To modify the game so that a **Jack does not force pickups** and a **Three forces the next player to pick up 3 cards**, follow these steps:

### Changes to `card.ts`
1. **Modify the `forcesPickup` function** to remove the Jack rule.
2. **Modify the `numberToPickup` function** to add the rule for Three.

#### Update `forcesPickup`:
Remove the condition that forces a pickup for black Jacks.

```ts
export const forcesPickup = (card: Card) => {
    return (
        card.rank === CardRank.Two ||
        (card.rank === CardRank.Joker && card.suit === CardSuit.Joker) ||
        card.rank === CardRank.Three // Add rule for Three
    );
};
```

#### Update `numberToPickup`:
Modify the function to remove the Jack's effect and add the rule for Three.

```ts
export const numberToPickup = (card: Card) => {
    if (!forcesPickup(card)) return 0;
    switch (card.rank) {
        case CardRank.Two:
            return 2;
        case CardRank.Joker:
            return 4;
        case CardRank.Three: // Add rule for Three
            return 3;
        default:
            return 0;
    }
};
```

### Result:
- **Jacks no longer force pickups**.
- **Threes now force the next player to pick up 3 cards**.

Would you like me to update the game logic in `game.ts` as well?
This section specifically deals with handling a special case where playing a **red Jack** on a **black Jack** "resets" the `forcedPickupCount`. If Jacks should no longer affect pickups, this logic is unnecessary.  


// Take them from the players hand
            this.hands[playerIndex] = this.hands[playerIndex].filter(x => !turn.played.includes(x));

            // special case where you play a red jack and then a black jack on a black jack
            // which only leaves 7 cards to pick up - but this case is handled later, here
            // we just 'reset'
            if (this.forcedPickupCount > 0) {
                const lastPlayed = this.played[this.played.length - 1].played;
                const lastTopPlayed = lastPlayed[lastPlayed.length - 1];
                if ((lastTopPlayed.rank === CardRank.Jack) && (colour(lastTopPlayed.suit) === CardColour.Black)) {
                    const firstPlayed = turn.played[0];
                    if ((firstPlayed.rank === CardRank.Jack) && (colour(firstPlayed.suit) === CardColour.Red)) {
                        // move our pickup pile back to our standard pile
                        this.forcedPickupCount = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
### Changes Needed:
1. **Remove the entire `if (this.forcedPickupCount > 0) { ... }` block**  
   - Since Jacks are no longer pickup cards, there's no need to check for a red Jack canceling a black Jack's effect.
  
2. **Ensure Jacks donâ€™t contribute to `forcedPickupCount` elsewhere**  
   - If elsewhere in the code Jacks are increasing `forcedPickupCount`, that logic should also be removed.

### Updated Code:
```ts
// Take them from the players hand
this.hands[playerIndex] = this.hands[playerIndex].filter(x => !turn.played.includes(x));

// Removed Jack-specific pickup logic
```

After removing this, Jacks will no longer impact the pickup mechanic at all. Do you want me to check for any other dependencies on Jacks in your game logic?
