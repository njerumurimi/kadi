To modify the game so that a **Jack does not force pickups** and a **Three forces the next player to pick up 3 cards**, follow these steps:

### Changes to `card.ts`
1. **Modify the `forcesPickup` function** to remove the Jack rule.
2. **Modify the `numberToPickup` function** to add the rule for Three.

#### Update `forcesPickup`:
Remove the condition that forces a pickup for black Jacks.

```ts
export const forcesPickup = (card: Card) => {
    return (
        card.rank === CardRank.Two ||
        (card.rank === CardRank.Joker && card.suit === CardSuit.Joker) ||
        card.rank === CardRank.Three // Add rule for Three
    );
};
```

#### Update `numberToPickup`:
Modify the function to remove the Jack's effect and add the rule for Three.

```ts
export const numberToPickup = (card: Card) => {
    if (!forcesPickup(card)) return 0;
    switch (card.rank) {
        case CardRank.Two:
            return 2;
        case CardRank.Joker:
            return 4;
        case CardRank.Three: // Add rule for Three
            return 3;
        default:
            return 0;
    }
};
```

### Result:
- **Jacks no longer force pickups**.
- **Threes now force the next player to pick up 3 cards**.

Would you like me to update the game logic in `game.ts` as well?
