To implement the new Jack rule in your **game.ts**, you need to modify the turn logic to handle skipping players instead of forcing a pickup when a **black Jack (Clubs or Spades)** is played. Hereâ€™s how you can update your logic:

### **Steps to Modify the Jack Rule**
1. **Change `forcesPickup`**: Remove Jacks from forcing pickups.
2. **Track Skipped Players**: Maintain a count of how many turns should be skipped.
3. **Handle Jack Chaining**: Allow players to play a Jack to avoid being skipped.

### **Update `card.ts`**
#### **1. Modify `forcesPickup` to Remove Jacks**
Replace:
```ts
export const forcesPickup = (card: Card) => {
    return ((card.rank === CardRank.Two) || ((card.rank === CardRank.Joker) && (card.suit === CardSuit.Joker)) || ((card.rank === CardRank.Jack) && ((card.suit === CardSuit.Clubs) || (card.suit === CardSuit.Spades))));
}
```
With:
```ts
export const forcesPickup = (card: Card) => {
    return ((card.rank === CardRank.Two) || ((card.rank === CardRank.Joker) && (card.suit === CardSuit.Joker)));
};
```
---

### **Update `game.ts`**
#### **2. Add a `skippedTurns` Counter**
Modify your `Game` class by adding:
```ts
/**
 * Number of consecutive turns to skip due to Jacks
 */
skippedTurns!: number;
```
Initialize in `reset()`:
```ts
this.skippedTurns = 0;
```
---

#### **3. Modify `applyTurn` to Skip Players**
In `applyTurn`, after checking for special cards, modify the Jack handling:
```ts
if (topPlayed.rank === CardRank.Jack) {
    if (colour(topPlayed.suit) === CardColour.Black) {
        // Black Jacks skip players
        this.skippedTurns += turn.played.length; // One Jack = 1 skip, multiple Jacks = multiple skips
    }
}
```
---

#### **4. Skip Players in `nextPlayer()`**
Modify `nextPlayer()` to account for skipping turns:
```ts
nextPlayer = () => {
    if (this.skippedTurns > 0) {
        this.skippedTurns--; // Reduce the skip count
        return this.turns[1 + this.skippedTurns]!; // Skip the required number of turns
    }
    return this.turns[1]!;
};
```
---

#### **5. Allow Jack Chains**
Modify `applyTurn` so that if the next player has a **Jack**, they can override the skip:
```ts
if (topPlayed.rank === CardRank.Jack && colour(topPlayed.suit) === CardColour.Black) {
    const nextIndex = this.turns.indexOf(this.nextPlayer());
    const nextPlayerHand = this.hands[nextIndex];
    
    if (nextPlayerHand.some(card => card.rank === CardRank.Jack)) {
        // If the next player has a Jack, they can play it and reset the skip counter
        this.skippedTurns = 0;
    }
}
```
---

### **Final Behavior**
- **A single Black Jack skips 1 player**.
- **Multiple Black Jacks skip multiple players**.
- **A player with a Jack can counter a skip by playing another Jack**.
